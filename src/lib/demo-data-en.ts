  // ─── Final Document ───

> The competitor opened the market. But the e-commerce seller slot is still empty. **1-day setup · 1/3 the price**, $15K to start, profitable at 25 customers.

## Decision line

> "In 4 weeks, I'll show you a working beta in front of one e-commerce seller."

## One-page summary

| Item | Competitor | Us |
|------|--------|------|
| Target | Enterprise | **E-commerce sellers (SMB)** |
| Setup | 2 weeks | **1 day** (pre-trained, assumption) |
| Price | $800/mo+ | **$290/mo** |
| Headcount | PM + outsourced | **1 senior + 1 junior, dedicated** |

After signing up for the competitor as a seller and using it for an hour — the biggest weakness is **"doesn't fit our industry, so a human ends up answering anyway."** Industry-specificity is our opportunity.
<!-- PATCH_0 -->

## 6-month execution

- **MVP in 4 weeks** — auto-response + e-commerce templates + dashboard
- **Cost $15K** — infrastructure $12K + marketing $3K (no incremental headcount)
- **Break-even at 25 customers** — revenue $7,250 / monthly profit $1,000
- **Safety net** — if existing product breaks, 1 dedicated person returns immediately
<!-- PATCH_1 -->

## Weakest assumption (validate first)

> **"Will an e-commerce seller really pay $290/month?"**
>
> We haven't asked a single seller. That's the first risk, and the first item in next steps.

## Next steps

1. **This week** — call 5 e-commerce sellers ("Would you pay $290/month?")
2. **Week 2** — CEO review (direction, headcount, budget approval)
3. **Week 6** — MVP launch + first pilot`,

  finalPatches: [
    // concern[0] applied: Specific target industry
    `
### Target Industry: E-commerce

Specific case: 80% of e-commerce seller support tickets follow repeat patterns (shipping/exchanges/returns). Industry-specific automation can **cut support staff costs by 30%**.

Generic solutions require 2-3 months to learn industry-specific terminology and workflows. We deliver in **under 1 week** through pre-training.`,
    // concern[1] applied: Customer acquisition strategy
    `

### Customer Acquisition Strategy

- **Existing network**: Propose free pilots to 10 SMBs within the team's personal network
- **Free trial**: 1 month free, then convert to paid after demonstrating results (target 30% conversion rate)
- **Content marketing**: Industry-specific success story blog posts to drive inbound leads`,

> Company S comes to introduce themselves; we come to solve *your* problem.

## The core line

> "The team you meet at the pitch is the team that runs the project. Not Company S's sales team."

## Us vs Company S

| Dimension | Company S (large SI) | Us (8-person) |
|------|-----|------|
| At the pitch | Sales + PM | **3 seniors hands-on** |
| First deliverable after kickoff | Requirements doc (6-8 weeks) | Working demo possible |
| Decision-making | 3 internal layers | Immediate |
| Prior relationship with client | None | **6 months with the logistics lead** |

(Company S pattern = estimated from mid-size SI industry averages. Not every Company S project runs this way.)

## The 3-chapter pitch (30 minutes)

| Chapter | Time | Content |
|---|---|---|
| 1. The client's real problem | **12 min** | 3 problems extracted from 6 months of logistics lead conversations |
| 2. How we're different from Company S | 8 min | What's different for the same $300K |
| 3. The post-pitch promise | 10 min | Concrete deliverables within 1 week of the pitch |

Company S spends 15 of 30 minutes introducing themselves. **We spend 20 minutes on the client's story.**
<!-- PATCH_0 -->

## The honest line (weakest assumption)

> "Will the logistics lead's referral alone carry this through to executive approval?"
>
> A referral opens the door; executives make the call. The evidence that convinces the executives has to be built at the pitch itself.
<!-- PATCH_1 -->

## The post-pitch promise (one week out)

The 3 seniors at the pitch stay on the project. Within one week after the pitch, we deliver the first tangible output.`,

  finalBase: `# Company T 30% Cut — Leadership Meeting Response Strategy

> Company T 30% cut is a short-term play funded by Series B $20M (monthly burn $1.5-2M est → ~12-18 month runway). Of our 80 customers, real churn intent is 1, revenue impact 1.1%.

## 4 response scenarios

| Option | A. Match | B. Selective discount + value defense | C. Wait / endure | D. Premium repositioning |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Price | Blanket cut | 15% for 10 at-risk only | Hold | Raise |
| Monthly profit | **-75%** | **-3%** | 0% → -15% | -10% short, +20% long |
| Lead time | Immediate | Within a week | Immediate | **6+ months** |
| Comes from | Defensive instinct | Balanced instinct | Wait instinct | Offensive instinct |

Every instinct misses something. A teammate validated and reinforced each one.

## Weakest assumption (validate first)

> "Are those 3 customers actually churning, or just price-shopping?"
>
> There may be a gap between sales\'s "crisis" signal and the actual words. Confirming the exact wording one more time is the first line of the report.
<!-- PATCH_1 -->

## Immediate execution (this week)

1. **Finalize 10 at-risk customers** + apply selective discount (if that scenario is chosen)
2. **Ship sales value script** + discount-authority matrix
3. **Get finance sign-off on margin rate** + scenario sim

## Monitoring

- Monthly churn rate review — >5% triggers partial response
- Pre-book 12-month Company T reassessment on the calendar

*Estimate caveats: Company T monthly burn rate and our margin rate are both estimates. The word "estimated" must appear in the report.*`,

### Customer-Facing Value (Differentiation Specifics)

The value our customers get that justifies the premium:

1. **Dedicated account manager**: Competitor uses a call center; we give you a direct line to your person
2. **Custom configuration**: Industry-specific pre-optimization — results from week one
3. **Fast response**: Under 4 hours to respond (competitor average: 24 hours)`,
    `

### Churn Impact Quantified

| Churn Rate | Monthly Revenue Loss | Annual Impact |
|------------|---------------------|---------------|
| 5% | ~$5,000 | $60,000 |
| 10% | ~$10,000 | $120,000 |
| 15% | ~$15,000 | $180,000 |

At the estimated 5-10% churn rate, **annual impact is $60K-$120K.** The goal is to keep churn below 5% through the differentiation strategy.`,
