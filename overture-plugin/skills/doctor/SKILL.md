description: "Diagnose Overture installation issues. Checks skills, agents, data directories, journal integrity, and configuration. Use when something isn't working or after /overture:setup reports warnings."
allowed-tools: Read, Bash, Glob, Grep

## When to use

- ✓ A skill isn't being recognized or producing errors
- ✓ After /overture:setup reports warnings
- ✓ Journal data seems corrupted or missing
- ✓ Output files aren't being saved properly
- ✗ First installation (use /overture:setup)
- ✗ Changing preferences (use /overture:configure)

**Always respond in the same language the user uses.**

**No box drawing.** Do NOT use `╭╮╰╯`, `┌│└`, `═══╪`, `───┼`, `━━━`, or any Unicode box characters. Use `---`, `**bold**`, and whitespace for structure.

## Diagnostic Flow

Run ALL checks, collect all results, then present a unified report. Never stop at the first issue.

### Check 1: Skill files

For each expected skill, verify:
1. File exists at the expected path
2. File has valid YAML frontmatter (starts with `---`)
3. Frontmatter contains required fields: `name`, `description`

Expected skills (10):
- `reframe`, `recast`, `rehearse`, `refine`, `overture`, `help` (core)
- `setup`, `doctor`, `configure`, `patterns` (utility)

Search in BOTH locations:
- `~/.claude/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` (global)
- `.claude/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` (project)

### Check 2: Agent files

Verify all 7 agents exist:
- `devils-advocate.md` — critical challenge
- `researcher.md` — 수진, research analyst
- `strategist.md` — 현우, strategy analyst
- `writer.md` — 서연, communication specialist
- `numbers.md` — 민재, quantitative analyst
- `user-voice.md` — 지영, user advocate
- `lead-synthesizer.md` — lead synthesis

Search in BOTH locations:
- `~/.claude/agents/{name}.md` (global)
- `.claude/agents/{name}.md` (project)

Each file must have valid YAML frontmatter with `name`, `description`, `context`, `tools`.

### Check 3: Data directory

Check `.overture/` in project root:
1. Directory exists and is writable
2. `journal.md` — exists, parse entry count, check last entry date
3. `reframe.md` — exists (from last /reframe run)
4. `recast.md` — exists (from last /recast run)
5. `rehearse.md` — exists (from last /rehearse run)
6. `refine.md` — exists (from last /refine run)
7. `last-run.md` — exists (from last /overture run)
8. `config.json` — exists (from /overture:configure)

### Check 4: Journal integrity

If `journal.md` exists:
1. Count total entries (lines starting with `## `)
2. Check for malformed entries (missing required fields)
3. Report date range (oldest → newest)
4. Check for duplicate dates
5. Report entry breakdown: reframe/recast/rehearse/refine/overture
6. Check for new v0.5 fields (Confidence, stakes, convergence) — warn if old format

### Check 5: Configuration

If `config.json` exists in `.overture/`:
1. Parse JSON — report any syntax errors
2. Validate known fields have valid values
3. Check version — warn if <0.5.0 (needs update)
4. Report current settings

### Check 6: Context contract chain

If output files exist, verify the contract chain is intact:
1. `reframe.md` has `## Context Contract` section
2. `recast.md` references data from reframe contract
3. `rehearse.md` references data from recast contract
4. `refine.md` references data from rehearse contract
5. Check for new contract fields (framing_confidence, assumptions with evaluation, storyline, translated_approvals, convergence_metrics)

Report any broken links or missing fields in the chain.

### Check 7: Reference files

Check if reference/support files exist in the skill directories:
- `reframe/references/reframing-strategies.md`
- `recast/references/execution-design.md`
- `rehearse/references/persona-design.md`
- `rehearse/references/risk-classification.md`
- `refine/references/convergence.md`
- `overture/references/decision-quality.md`

## Output

Present a unified diagnostic report:

[Issues found / All clear]

### If issues found:

For each issue, provide:
1. What's wrong (specific)
2. Why it matters
3. How to fix it (actionable command or instruction)

**Issues:**

✗ Missing: /overture:patterns skill
— Impact: Cannot analyze journal patterns
— Fix: Run /overture:setup to reinstall

⚠ Journal has 52 entries (recommended: archive after 50)
— Impact: Slower startup reads
— Fix: Run /overture:patterns and accept archive prompt

⚠ Config version 0.3.0 (current: 0.5.0)
— Impact: Missing new settings
— Fix: Run /overture:configure to update

✗ Contract chain broken: rehearse.md missing framing_confidence from reframe
— Impact: /refine won't have full context
— Fix: Re-run /rehearse to regenerate with updated contract

### If all clear:

✓ All systems healthy. Overture v0.5.0 is ready.
