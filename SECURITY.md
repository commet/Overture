# Security Model

## Architecture

Overture uses a **client-first architecture** with Supabase as the backend:

- **Authentication**: Google OAuth + Email/Password via Supabase Auth
- **Authorization**: Row Level Security (RLS) on all 9 tables — `auth.uid() = user_id`
- **API Protection**: JWT verification + atomic rate limiting via Supabase RPC
- **Session Management**: Supabase JS client (client-side) + middleware (server-side)

## How data is protected

| Layer | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Route access** | Next.js middleware redirects unauthenticated users to `/login` |
| **Client-side guard** | `AuthGuard` component as a second layer |
| **API endpoints** | JWT token verification via `supabase.auth.getUser(token)` |
| **Database** | RLS policies enforce `auth.uid() = user_id` on every table |
| **Rate limiting** | Atomic Supabase RPC (`SECURITY DEFINER`), not client-writable |
| **User deletion** | `ON DELETE CASCADE` on all `user_id` foreign keys |

## API endpoints

| Endpoint | Auth | Rate Limited | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `POST /api/llm` | JWT (optional — anon trial) | 10/day (auth), 8/day (anon IP) | Proxy mode (server's API key) |
| `POST /api/llm/direct` | None (user's own key) | No | Direct mode (user provides key) |
| `POST /api/boss/saju` | None (public) | No | Saju analysis (no LLM call) |
| `POST /api/slack/send` | JWT required | No | Send to Slack channel |
| `GET /api/slack/channels` | JWT required | No | List Slack channels |
| `GET /api/slack/oauth` | JWT (query param) | No | Initiate Slack OAuth |
| `GET /api/slack/callback` | HMAC state | No | Slack OAuth callback |
| `GET /api/cron/daily-report` | CRON_SECRET | No | Daily report email |

## Known limitations & trade-offs

1. **localStorage as primary storage**: Data is stored in localStorage first, then synced to Supabase asynchronously. If sync fails, data exists only in the browser. This trade-off prioritizes speed and offline capability over durability.

2. **Content-Security-Policy**: CSP is configured in `middleware.ts` with per-request nonce. `script-src 'nonce-{nonce}' 'strict-dynamic'` prevents inline script injection. `style-src 'unsafe-inline'` is allowed for Tailwind CSS. Additional headers: `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Strict-Transport-Security` with preload.

3. **Client-side prompt construction**: System prompts are built client-side with user-provided data (persona names, feedback logs, etc.) interpolated directly. This is acceptable because users are constructing prompts for their own LLM calls — there is no shared prompt context between users.

4. **In-memory rate limit cache**: `getCurrentUserId()` caches the user ID for 60 seconds to avoid excessive `getUser()` network calls. This means a revoked session may continue to function for up to 60 seconds client-side (server-side RLS still enforces access).

If you discover a security vulnerability, please email the maintainer directly rather than opening a public issue.
