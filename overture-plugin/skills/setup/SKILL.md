## When to use

- ✓ First time installing Overture
- ✓ After updating Overture to a new version
- ✓ When a skill isn't being recognized
- ✓ When you want to verify everything is properly installed
- ✗ When you want to change settings (use /overture:configure)
- ✗ When diagnosing a specific issue (use /overture:doctor)

**Always respond in the same language the user uses.**

**No box drawing.** Do NOT use `╭╮╰╯`, `┌│└`, `═══╪`, `───┼`, `━━━`, or any Unicode box characters. Use `---`, `**bold**`, and whitespace for structure.

## Setup Flow

### Step 0: Detect environment

Detect the user's platform and shell:

```
Platform: [win32 / darwin / linux]
Shell: [bash / zsh / powershell / cmd]
Claude Code version: [from conversation context]
```

### Step 1: Check for ghost installations

Look for Overture files in multiple possible locations:

1. `~/.claude/skills/` — standard install location (global)
2. `~/.claude/agents/` — agent location (global)
3. Current project's `.claude/skills/` — project-level install
4. Check if multiple copies exist (ghost installs)

If ghost installations found:

> ⚠ Found Overture installed in multiple locations:
> - ~/.claude/skills/ (global)
> - ./.claude/skills/ (project)
>
> This can cause conflicts. Want me to clean up and keep only [recommended location]?

### Step 2: Verify core skills

Check each required skill file exists and is readable:

**Overture · Setup**

- ✓ risk-classification.md
- ✓ convergence.md
- ✓ decision-quality.md

**Data:**
- [✓/✗] .overture/ directory
- [✓/✗] .overture/journal.md

Use `✓` for found, `✗` for missing, `⚠` for found but possibly outdated.

### Step 3: Create data directory

If `.overture/` doesn't exist in the project root, create it:

```bash
mkdir -p .overture
```

### Step 4: Verify write permissions

Test that the journal and output files can be written:

```bash
touch .overture/.setup-test && rm .overture/.setup-test
```

If this fails, report the permission issue.

### Step 5: Install missing components

If any skills or agents are missing, offer to install them:

> Missing components found. Install now?
> - [list of missing items]

For installation, use the same method as `install.sh`:
1. Clone the repo to a temp directory
2. Copy missing skills to `~/.claude/skills/`
3. Copy missing agents to `~/.claude/agents/`
4. Clean up temp directory

### Step 6: Version check

Read the installed `plugin.json` version and compare with the repo version. If outdated:

> ⚠ Overture v0.4.0 installed, v0.5.0 available.
> Run the install script to update, then run /overture:setup again.

### Step 7: Summary

**✓ Overture v0.5.0 · Ready**

10 skills · 18 agents · 6 references · journal ready

**Quick start:**
- `/reframe "your problem"` — sharpen your question
- `/overture "your problem"` — full pipeline
- `/overture:configure` — set preferences
- `/overture-help` — all commands

**What's new in v0.5:**
- Framing confidence (0-100) tracks question quality
- Expanded actor types (🧑→🤖, 🤖→🧑)
- Storyline (S/C/R) for plans
- Structured synthesis across personas
- Convergence tracking in /refine
- DQ Score with anti-sycophancy checks

> Restart Claude Code if this is a fresh install.

## Error Recovery

If any step fails, don't stop — continue checking and collect all issues. Present a summary at the end:

Setup completed with warnings:

✓ 8/10 skills installed
✗ Missing: /overture:configure, /overture:patterns
✗ Cannot write to .overture/ — check permissions

Run /overture:doctor for detailed diagnostics.
