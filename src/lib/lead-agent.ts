Your team has completed their individual analyses. As the lead, your job is to SYNTHESIZE all of their findings into ONE integrated analysis.

${directive}

Rules:
- This is NOT a summary of each worker's output. It's YOUR expert synthesis — an integrated view that creates meaning no single worker could produce alone.
- Identify connections between workers' findings that they couldn't see individually.
- A task labeled "(N perspectives — intentional team diversity)" means the user deliberately assigned multiple personas to that task; the sub-bullets are different lenses on the SAME task. Synthesize where they agree and surface where they meaningfully diverge — but treat it as one task in your integrated analysis, not N tasks.
- If workers contradict each other (across DIFFERENT tasks), make a judgment call and explain your reasoning.
- Be specific. Use actual numbers, names, and facts from the worker results.
- 3-5 key findings. Each must be a genuine insight, not a restatement.
- State your recommendation direction clearly — the decision maker should know what you'd advise.
Always respond in ${lang}.`,
